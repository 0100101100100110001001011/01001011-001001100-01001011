I know this code probably looks like a kindergartner’s writing, but I needed a place to say a few words and a last goodbye. 

Take care. Cuídate mucho. Have fun. Be safe. Feliz Navidad, Happy New Year and Happy Lunar New Year. Hope you had fun in Japan and I hope you’re not too cold. I hope you have a nice life. i hope you never have restless dreams. I hope you heal, and I hope it never rains all the time for you. Always. I wish I could say a lot more, because there is so much to say but there is no time; the year is about to end, and I have to go and seek a truth beyond you and me. 

I’ll keep it brief. I wish I could say the three words. In Spanish they are only two short words, and in Chinese they are three. It’s in numbers too. 520. 143. 01001001 00100000 01101100 01101111 01110110 01100101 00100000 01111001 01101111 01110101. I wish you had let me feel it; I wanted to bloom into it and into you. I wish you would have let me show it to you. I wish we had met when we were kids. Or when we’re older, with prescription meds and back issues, you from playing too many video games and coding and me from bad posture during endless hours of art making, but despite the sickness and pain, we are healed.

In Japanese there is also a three-word phrase that I think defines what it is that I felt for you a lot better. You probably might have heard of it. I didn’t understand it until I met you. Koi no yokan. That is what I always knew. That is what I felt the night of October 29th, 2022. That is the only thing I can say to you. You were my premonition. Koi no yokan.
Koi no yokan. 
Koi no yokan. 
Koi no yokan. 
Koi no yokan. 
Koi no yokan.
Koi no yokan. 
Koi no yokan.
